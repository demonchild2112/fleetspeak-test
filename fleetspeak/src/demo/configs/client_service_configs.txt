# This is a text format fleetspeak.ClientServiceConfigs as defined in
# system.proto.
#
# These are example service configurations, which can be signed and imported
# into a client configuration by configurator.go.
#
# IMPORTANT!!!!
#
# These configurations are simplified examples meant for testing and
# demonstration. They are not particularly safe. The Stdin service factory will
# run 'cmd' with parameters chosen by the server.
#
# More explicity, if the server is owned or its TLS cert & key stolen, the
# attacker would be able to run any of the listed commands. Large installations
# should be concerned by this. Limiting what configurations you sign is your
# last best hope against such an incident. With great power comes great
# exploitability.
